Create a feature branch in git  and switch to the branch

========================================

# git branch

Create a new branch

# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch

# git checkout feature1

[OR]

Create a new branch and switch to the branch also

# git checkout -b feature2

3. Merge the commits/files of new branch to master

Before merging always switch to the destination branch

# git checkout master

# git merge feature1 master

< git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch>


Check which branches are merged to master

git branch -a --merged master

Check which branches are not merged to master

git branch -a --no-merged master


4. Delete a branch which is not merged with master branch

# git branch -D <branchname>

Delete a branch whose commits have been merged with the master branch

# git branch -d feature1


5. Reset the commit history

# git reset --hard <commitid>

here:

commit id is where the HEAD will point to now.

All the other commits above it will be deleted and the chnages will also be deleted from LR and working directory.

It is a destructive command


6. Rebase merging strategy in GIT (rewind the commit history)

# git branch

you should be on the master branch

Now create a new branch

# git branch feature1

On the master branch create 2  new commits

example of my log on master branch

8bce083 (HEAD -> master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e (feature1) added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


Now switch to feature branch and create 2 new commits


example of my log on master branch

9981946 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
156dc12 done in feature branch
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


I want to rebase - re organise the base of my feature branch

Make sure you are on feature branch

# git rebase master


The commit history will be as such:

41f5d79 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
9469e15 done in feature branch
8bce083 (master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html

GITHUB:

==================================================

Login to github.com

============================


Personal access tokens (classic) function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a github password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.

1. Create a personal access token:

 > clcik on user menu which is on the extreme right
 > click on settings in that
 > scroll down, on left side you will see developer settings -- click on it
 > on left side 3 rd option --> personla Access token
 > select tokens(classic)
 > click on generate new token --> click on generate new token classic
 > in note --give token name as token19
 > expiration --> leave as is
 > select scopes --> clcik on repo checkbox
 > scroll down and clcik on generate token
 > the generated token need to be copied safely

Make sure to copy your personal access token now. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again!

token:

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 



2. Create a remote repository

3. Connect local repo to remote repo

# git checkout master

# git remote add origin https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject19Apr.git

# git remote -v 

Remove origin if needed

# git remote rm origin


Push data from local to remote

# git push origin master

username : github
password: token

================================

Create a file in github on master branch and pull the file to merge in local repoisotry master branch


Once file is create don master branch of remote repo

go to local repo

# git checkout master

# git pull origin master

pull will fecth changes and merge them with LR and WD

================================


Clone a remote repository to local machine

# git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject19Apr.git


Forking - complete
===========================================
