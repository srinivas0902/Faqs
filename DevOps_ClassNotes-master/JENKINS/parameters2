Here is an example of a stage that will be executed based on the condition that we get from the choice parameter.

The parameter name is ENVIRONMENT, and we access it in the stage as params.ENVIRONMENT. 
So when the choice parameter matches PROD, it will execute the steps mentioned in the stage.

stage('Deploy to Production') {
            when {
                expression { 
                   return params.ENVIRONMENT == 'PROD'
                }
            }
            steps {
                    sh """
                    echo "deploy to production"
                    """
                }
            }
   }
