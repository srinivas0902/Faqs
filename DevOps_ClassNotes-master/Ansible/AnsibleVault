Encrypting sensitive data with Ansible Vault.
Ansible Vault encrypts variables or files so, the sensitive data such as passwords or keys are not visible.

In our example, we can see that the SSH password is visible in the group_vars file. Let's encrypt it.

Inside the group_vars/routers.yml file, we have variables. Some variables, like the network_os and user_name, are not secret. 
Other variables, like the SSH password, is confidential.

cat routers.yml 
---

#nonsensitive data
ansible_network_os: ios
ansible_user: ansible

#sensitive data
ansible_password: cisco123

We can make distinction between sensitive and nonsensitive variables using two methods. 
The first one is to split the variables between two files and encrypt the sensitive file.

Step 1 - Create a vault-encrypted file within the directory that will live alongside the unencrypted routers.yml file. In this file, define the sensitive variables that used to be in the group_vars/routers.yml file. Use the same variable names, 
but prepend the string vault_ to indicate that these variables are defined in the vault-protected file.

ansible-vault create vault
New Vault password: 
Confirm New Vault password: 

vault yml file

---
vault_ansible_password: cisco123


cat inventory/group_vars/routers/vault 

To view the contents of an encrypted file without editing it, you can use the ansible-vault view command as shown below.

$ ansible-vault view vault 
Vault password: 
---

vault_ansible_password: cisco123


To edit an encrypted file in place, use the ansible-vault edit command. This command decrypts the file to a temporary file, allows you to edit the content, then saves and re-encrypts the content and removes the temporary file when you close the editor.

Let's run the playbook again.

The most straightforward way of decrypting content at runtime is to have Ansible prompt you for the appropriate credentials. You can do this by adding the --ask-vault-pass to any ansible or ansible-playbook command.

 ansible-playbook show_version.yml -i /etc/ansible/inventory/host-file --ask-vault-pass
Vault password:
