Hostfile:

and Variables

Playbook which runs 'show version | incl Version' command on both routers and show us the output.



---

- name: Cisco show version example
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
    - name: run show version on the routers
      ios_command:
        commands: show version | incl Version
      register: output

    - name: print output
      debug:
        var: output.stdout_lines


YAML file starts with ---
name - Any arbitrary name
hosts - Referring to the inventory group called 'routers'
gather_facts - We don't need to gather any information from the routers. This may be useful when working with servers.
connection - Playbook is run against a network device.
register - You can create variables from the output of an Ansible task with the task keyword register. You can use registered variables in any later tasks in your play
debug - This module prints statements during execution.
stdout_lines - Ansible will print the output in an easy to readable format.

We are running two tasks, first one runs show version | incl Version on both routers and saves the output in a variable called output.
 The Second task prints the variable ouput in a nice format.



Run multiple 'show commands' at once
You can run multiple show commands within the same task.


- name: Cisco ip interface brief + ip route
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
    - name: run show ip interface brief + ip route
      ios_command:
        commands: 
          - show ip interface brief
          - show ip route
      register: output

    - name: print output
      debug:
        var: output.stdout_lines
