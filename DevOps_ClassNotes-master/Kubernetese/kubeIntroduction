Docker swarm.                 								     
  create a cluster of machines - swarm cluseter: manager and worker nodes
  manger and worker both take the load, replicas are created on MANAGER node as well as worker node
  > with 1 GB nodes we can create a cluster
  > that can orchestrate docker container only
 >  Bridge/ Overlay n/w

Kubernetes:

   you have cluster of machine : cluster of menions : kube or k8s cluster
   MASTER and SLAVE and in k8s MASTER will not take any replicas, all replicas will be on slaves
   > high configuration machine to create the master and slave, atleast 4GB & 2 CPU core
   > can orchestrate containers of any type:
        > docker 
       > RKT
       > CRIO
      > Container-D
  > we have to set up our n/w in K8s : CNI
