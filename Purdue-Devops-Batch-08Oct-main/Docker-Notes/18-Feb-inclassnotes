Bind mounts :

Any directory on the host machine can preserve data form container


We have a directory on the host machine with some config.xml file in it
The directory is present on the host machine
you have to make the config.xml available in the container directory : /etc

 593  mkdir sonal
  594  cd sonal
  595  touch config.xml
  596  ls
  597  pwd
  598  docker run -it --name newc1 -v /root/sonal/:/etc ubuntu


============================================================

Deploy an application on docker container and access the container from browser


Devloper gives you source code : github


https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

you need to take this html code and deploy on apache httpd server

deployment env is docker container:

IMAGE: httpd


all code files to be made available on the container directory - /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/



=====================================================

Creating Custom Images:
================================

2 methods:

> from an exiting container

1. you can convert your container into an image   ==> docker commit the current container into an Image

docker commit webapp  mywebimg:01

2. ship the new custom image to dockerhub(REGISTRY)

First change the image name to contain your repository name

docker tag oldimgname sonal04/newimagename

docker login

docker push sonal04/newimagename

3. others can pull the image and create the container

docker pull imagename


















> from a dockerfile
